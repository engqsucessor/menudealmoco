### 5. Data Transfer

**Free Tier:**
- âœ… **100GB/month outbound FREE** (applies always, not just first year)

**Estimated Usage:**
- Average restaurant page: ~500KB (includes images, API calls)

**If you exceed 100GB:**
- $0.09/GB for next 10TB
- 150GB usage = 50GB overage = **$4.50/month**

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate (No Impact)
1. âœ… **Already optimized:** Using t3.micro (smallest production instance)
2. âœ… **Already optimized:** Minimal EBS storage (8GB)
3. âœ… **Already optimized:** Docker multi-stage builds keep images small

### If Costs Increase

1. **Switch to Lightsail** ($3.50/month for similar specs)
   - Fixed pricing, easier to predict
   - Includes data transfer allowance
   - Less flexible but more cost-effective for small apps

2. **Implement CloudFront CDN** (Free Tier: 1TB outbound/month)
   - Reduces data transfer costs
   - Improves performance globally
   - Caches static assets

3. **Schedule EC2 downtime** (if 24/7 not needed)
   - Use Lambda to start/stop instance
   - Save ~70% if only running business hours

4. **Move secrets to Parameter Store** (Free alternative)
   - AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
   - FREE for standard parameters
   - Save $0.40/month

## Hidden Costs to Watch

### Unlikely but Possible
- **DDoS attack:** Could spike data transfer costs (mitigate with AWS Shield Basic - free)
- **Database growth:** If SQLite grows beyond 8GB, need larger EBS volume
- **Image storage growth:** More restaurant photos = larger ECR images
- **High traffic spike:** Could exceed 100GB free data transfer

### Recommended Monitoring
```bash
# Set up AWS Budgets (FREE)
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id <your-account-id> \
  --budget BudgetName=MenuDealMoco,BudgetLimit={Amount=15,Unit=USD}

# Enable cost alerts at $10 and $15 thresholds
```

## 3-Year Cost Projection

| Year | Monthly Avg | Annual Total | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Year 1 | $0.57 | $6.84 | $6.84 |
| Year 2 | $8.80 | $105.60 | $112.44 |

## Break-Even Analysis

**Your setup vs Hetzner (â‚¬10/month):**

- **Year 1:** AWS saves you $124.08
- **Year 2:** AWS saves you $25.20
- **Year 3:** AWS saves you $25.20

**Total 3-year savings with AWS:** $174.48

---

## Verdict

### âœ… Excellent Value
Your AWS setup is **extremely cost-effective**, especially in Year 1:

1. **First year:** $6.84 total (94% cheaper than Hetzner)
2. **Subsequent years:** $105.60/year (19% cheaper than Hetzner)
3. **Better infrastructure:** Auto-scaling capable, managed services, better security
4. **Professional setup:** IAM roles, Secrets Manager, ECR for CI/CD

### ðŸ’¡ Recommendation
**Keep this AWS setup.** The Free Tier benefits are substantial, and even after Year 1, you're still getting better value than traditional VPS hosting with more professional infrastructure.

## Questions?

**If your traffic grows significantly:**
- CloudFront CDN can handle 100x traffic increase with minimal cost impact
- Consider upgrading to t3.small (~$15/month) only if CPU consistently >80%

**If you want to reduce costs further:**
- Switch Secrets Manager â†’ Parameter Store (saves $4.80/year)
- Consider AWS Lightsail for fixed pricing ($42/year for 1GB RAM instance)

**Current setup is optimal for your use case.**
